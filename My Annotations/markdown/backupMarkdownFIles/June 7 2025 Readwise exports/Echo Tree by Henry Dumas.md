Take This River!


The sky and night kiss between the wind


‘Africa, somewhere is Africa.
Do you understand


‘Evvie, I do not know America
Except maybe in my tears


Only river people know how to talk to the river when it’s mad


A couple drops of rain smacked me in the face, and the wind, she was whippin up a sermon.


big bones and little bones, parts of bones, chips, tid-bits, skulls, fingers and everything. I shut my mouth then. I knowed I was onto somethin. I had fished out somethin

When I strike you strike.
My eyes shall see only thee.
I shall set my brother free.

it blows up fingers that ride the wind off the hill down the valley and up toward the sun, a red tongue rolling down a blue-black throat. And the ear of the mountains listens


the silence of an empty lung about to breathe in
