At the center of the room under the dome’s celestial canopy, instead of an altar to the gods of Rome stood a chapel for the daemonic idols of capitalism: the City Bank’s vault


55 Wall Street was part of a scourge of neoclassicism found in the factories, banks, warehouses, and offices whose ersatz evocations of a European classical past, as social critic Lewis Mumford observed, tried to conceal the labor exploitation, industrial organization, and monopoly combination of the modern US economy

Samuel Jarvis is among the most important if enigmatic figures in the early history of US imperial banking


financial possibilities of the US occupation (1898–1902) while his Banco Nacional de Cuba, organized in 1902, emerged as among the most important banking institutions in the early years of the república neocolonial, in which the Cuban economy and political system was increasingly dominated by the United States.

shrouded its modern office technologies, obscured its ties to the exploitation of oil and railroads and cotton and steel, and veiled its connections to the oligopolistic corporations using the bank as their private financier


in the US West Jarvis’s companies were underwritten by the historical violence of white settler colonialism: territorial dispossession enabled both the financialization of the West and the expansion of racial capitalism


In Cuba and the Dominican Republic, Jarvis’s ventures were guaranteed by force: protocols and agreements between the United States and the two countries enshrined financial stability through the threat of military intervention

organized in Cuba and the Dominican Republic by private financier Samuel M. Jarvis


Enabled by new, permissive banking legislation, they partnered with the United States’ regional and country banks in the formation of foreign finance corporations that rapidly created overseas branch networks and rushed to finance trade in foreign commodities—especially Cuban sugar. The most important of these corporations were the Mercantile Bank of the Americas (organized by Brown Brothers and Co., the J. P. Morgan–controlled Guaranty Trust Company, and J. & W. Seligman and Co.), and the American Foreign Banking Corporation, organized by the Chase National Bank of the City of New York

Meanwhile, the Caribbean’s local banking sector, having expanded during the war years, was gutted


North American financial institutions took over the assets and accounts of their vulnerable local rivals, consolidating their dominance in the Caribbean


Cuba, again, was devastated. Neither its financial sector nor its economy would recover from the crisis


securities affiliates” as vehicles for imperial accumulation


credit boom of the second half of the 1920s, with its unhinged speculation, deranged financing, and massive exportation


Securities affiliates, sometimes called “bastard” affiliates, were parallel institutions of dubious legality organized by national banking associations for investment and the marketing of foreign and corporate debt


Black Friday and the stock market crash of 1929 led to a crisis of finance capitalism. The crisis sparked a wave of both antibanking and anti-imperialist sentiment in the United States and the Caribbean


strong personal and financial ties between Wall Street and despotic and dictatorial regimes


the history of the internationalization of US finance and the imperial turn in US banking is in part a history of the transformations and challenges to banking law and the regulation of financial institutions in the national and international contexts


The 1863 National Bank Act created two legal categories of financial institutions existing within two different spheres of regulation


in many cases, bankers saw themselves as above the law and beyond the sovereign authority of individual states, especially in the Caribbean


National banking associations,” joint-stock commercial banks such as the City Bank


State banks


did not have access to the monetary reserves of the federal government and could not issue currency


stave off the kind of monetary crisis created by the Panic of 1907, when private bankers, led by J. P. Morgan, were forced to intervene to save the financial system from collapse. Proponents of a federal reserve system argued that a “banker’s bank” or a “banker of last resort” was needed to regulate the country’s economy through control of the monetary supply


The system was also set up as a way of enhancing the dollar’s international standing and to promote it as an international currency


shadow organizations unknown to regulators


these shadow organizations were created in consultation with Wall Street’s most powerful corporate law firms and its infernally brilliant corporate lawyers: Sullivan & Cromwell; Shearman & Sterling; Curtis, Mallet-Prevost; Rushmore, Bisbee & Stern; and Cravath, Swaine & Moore


Always white, always male, half frontiersman, half accountant, more hardened than the gentlemanly capitalists of the City of London, less knowing than the economic hit-men of popular literature, they were rogue


banking and empire. These men, individuals like the City Bank’s Roger L. Farnham, John H. Allen, and Joseph H. Durrell, have dwelt in the shadows of the larger-than-life robber barons


Racial capitalism suggests both the simultaneous historical emergence of racism and capitalism in the modern world and their mutual dependence


racism here is not merely one of individual beliefs but one of institutional policy


Racial capitalism’s representations often appeared in strange forms within the banking community. Take, for instance, its appearance in the City Bank Minstrel Show. Organized by the City Bank Club, the educational and social organization for the bank’s white employees, the City Bank Minstrel Show saw members of the bank’s staff donning blackface and “coon” outfits and performing musical and comedic skits for their peers


renovated to replicate the Pantheon, into a southern plantation. They saw an opening scene of “several darkies”—their coworkers at the City Bank, their white faces blackened with burnt cork—“gathered on the shore of a river engaging in the colored man’s national pastime, shooting craps,” followed by a program of skits and songs. The City Bank staff performed songs such as “Down in Monkeyville


from the National Bank of Commerce to the Chase Bank—also organized minstrel shows. These institutions also used blackface waiters and performers at social events.


Often, as in the story “Dark Finance,” their humor came from casting black people as economic illiterates


Racist stories, jokes, and anecdotes about Asians, Jews, Native Americans, and African Americans regularly appeared within the pages of bank publications


Bankers also staged Orientalist pageants, like “Chin Chin China Maid


Allen asserted that “cock-fighting and card playing are the [Haitian] national pastimes, and these, together with a supply of Haitian rum, are all that is necessary for a Haitian citizen’s perfect day.”


and generated an aura of impropriety, chicanery, crookedness, and corruption

Long after Jarvis’s institutions had collapsed, the bankers he employed continued to shape the terms and history of the internationalization of Wall Street.


In Cuba, a former employee described the Jarvis crowd as a “gang of crooks” who had come to the island “to plunder, exploit, not for any good purpose.”


They also founded local banks, including the Farmers and Drovers’ Bank, at Kingman, Kansas, and the Bank of Columbus, in Kansas City, and railroad and utility companies, including the Kansas Elevated Railway, the Augusta Railway Company, the North-East Street Railway Company, the Augusta Electric Company, the Ogden Street Railway Company


1891 to oversee the development of a Baltimore suburb. The suburb displaced a long-standing African American community and included covenants against blacks and Jews in the purchase agreements


the availability of free, unencumbered, and uninhabited land in the West was the precondition for accumulation; settlement was only possible by prior displacement, and the financial abstractions of land mortgages were underwritten by the historical violence of indigenous expulsion


Jarvis-Conklin was caught up in a spectacle of adverse publicity involving a Canadian clerk and gambling addict, Augustus Theophilus Kerr, a figure later dubbed “Embezzler Kerr” and the “Kansas City Swindler.” After inheriting a fortune estimated at $150,000, which he lost through stock and grain speculation in Ontario, Kerr opened a number of bucket shops (unregistered brokerage houses that used their customers’ capital to gamble on the stock exchange) in Toronto and then drifted to Kansas City, where he became the head bookkeeper of Jarvis-


Kerr was eventually tracked to Liverpool, where he was caught trying to cash securities belonging to Jarvis-Conklin


Overbuilding of railways and oversaturation of capital triggered a decline


in Cuba, the island having fallen into the hands of the United States following the defeat of Spain in 1898


Where Jarvis-Conklin had emerged as the preeminent institution serving as a conduit for the capital financing white settler colonialism in the US West, the NATC emerged as one of the most important financial institutions aiding the project of US colonialism in Cuba
