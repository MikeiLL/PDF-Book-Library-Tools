Thecla ends up condemned to death in the arena but is saved by divine protection with not only all the women—pagan and Christian alike—on her side but even with a lioness fighting on her behalf against bear and lion


visualize the dramatic moment when Thecla, having heard Paul preach the challenge of ascetic celibacy, decides to reject Thamyris, the man chosen to be her husband by parental authority


Paul. It is this sweeping indictment of what was clearly already in practice: “A woman must learn, listening in silence with all deference. I do not consent to them becoming teachers, or exercising authority over men


challenge to Roman normalcy represented by Christian celibacy—especially by female celibates thereby out of male control


that general principle concerning the traditional New Testament—that you cannot know inside without knowing outside


Eastern Christianity depicts not an individual but a communal resurrection of Christ


he is not the first or last Jewish martyr to die on a Roman cross


It shows Christ, wounded, haloed, robed, and carrying a scroll in earlier examples but a cross in later ones. He is surrounded by a mandorla of heavenly light, stands on the bifold gates of Hades shaped into cross format, with broken locks and shattered bolts all around


The Thunder: Perfect Mind’s assertion that “I am the first and the last. I am she who is honored and she who is mocked. I am the whore and the holy woman. I am the wife and the virgin


One of the features of this process involves transliteration—the use of Greco-Coptic words, written in our Roman alphabet, that remain untranslated


translation of these texts we have tried to make sure that all words are rendered into English


In only one case, the translation of certain names of (usually) heavenly figures, have we kept both the transliteration and the English translation


Open English Bible, Russell


we have changed that term to something inclusive such as human, person(s), or people


the reference system for these documents has generally been according to the column of the ancient manuscript accompanied by the line number of that column. So, for instance, a citation from the Gospel of Truth such as “18.36” has represented the eighteenth page of its Nag Hammadi manuscript and the thirty-sixth line


books have been chosen by a council of wise and nationally known spiritual leaders (listed on pages 555–558). An eclectic mix of bishops, rabbis, well-known authors, leaders of national churches, and women and men from African American, Native American, and European American backgrounds


In the past hundred years a number of new works from the first centuries have been discovered in the desert sands of Egypt, the markets of Cairo, and the libraries of ancient monasteries


a group of nineteen such leaders convened in February of 2012 in New Orleans


suggestions for four independent ways to read A New New Testament


1. Read personally. Read as if these documents matter deeply and immediately to you


2. Read thoughtfully. Think about the time and social setting in which the document was written, who might have written it, and why


3. Read imaginatively. Open your memory, heart, and imagination to these texts. Let them affect you; let them surprise you. Let them trigger not so much your opinions but your curiosity, and let them send you into fantasy


4. Read meditatively or prayerfully. Dwell on the words of the text that attract your attention. If certain words make you feel gratitude or warmth, go back over them and the ones around them again, lingering on them. Let them sink in


At the heart of the Gospel of Mary is a throbbing enthusiasm for becoming a true human being. For this ancient gospel, Jesus is the Savior because he teaches people how to welcome true humanity into themselves.


Mary seems to lose her voice at the end of the gospel


The importance of the Gospel of Mary for today’s worldwide negotiation of rights and roles for women cannot be underestimated


a major female figure whose leadership is actively disputed by the apostles introduces a dramatic new dimension to Christian understanding of women’s authority


the Gospel of Mary was written around the same time as both the Gospel of Luke and the First Letter to Timothy. Both of these New Testament works pay very explicit attention to the roles of women, but in strikingly different ways. First Timothy criticizes certain women in leadership as gossips and offensive in their dress, while encouraging them to be childbearing wives and attentive to their husbands. On the other hand, the Gospel of Luke adds many women to its story in an apparent dramatic appreciation of women, portrays women as supporting Jesus financially, and underlines that women were the first to see and believe Jesus’s resurrection
