From Easton's 1897 Bible Dictionary [easton]:

  Ensign
     (1.) Heb. 'oth, a military standard, especially of a single
     tribe (Num. 2:2). Each separate tribe had its own "sign" or
     "ensign."
     
       (2.) Heb. nes, a lofty signal, as a column or high pole (Num.
     21:8, 9); a standard or signal or flag placed on high mountains
     to point out to the people a place of rendezvous on the
     irruption of an enemy (Isa. 5:26; 11:12; 18:3; 62:10; Jer. 4:6,
     21; Ps. 60:4). This was an occasional signal, and not a military
     standard. Elevation and conspicuity are implied in the word.
     
       (3.) The Hebrew word _degel_ denotes the standard given to
     each of the four divisions of the host of the Israelites at the
     Exodus (Num. 1:52; 2:2; 10:14). In Cant. 2:4 it is rendered
     "banner." We have no definite information as to the nature of
     these military standards. (See {BANNER}.)
