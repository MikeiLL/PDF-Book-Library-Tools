From Easton's 1897 Bible Dictionary [easton]:

  Ensign
     (1.) Heb. 'oth, a military standard, especially of a single
     tribe (Num. 2:2). Each separate tribe had its own "sign" or
     "ensign."
     
       (2.) Heb. nes, a lofty signal, as a column or high pole (Num.
     21:8, 9); a standard or signal or flag placed on high mountains
     to point out to the people a place of rendezvous on the
     irruption of an enemy (Isa. 5:26; 11:12; 18:3; 62:10; Jer. 4:6,
     21; Ps. 60:4). This was an occasional signal, and not a military
     standard. Elevation and conspicuity are implied in the word.
     
       (3.) The Hebrew word _degel_ denotes the standard given to
     each of the four divisions of the host of the Israelites at the
     Exodus (Num. 1:52; 2:2; 10:14). In Cant. 2:4 it is rendered
     "banner." We have no definite information as to the nature of
     these military standards. (See {BANNER}.)

  Inert \In*ert"\, a. [L. iners, inertis, unskilled, idle; pref.
     in- + ars art: cf. F. inerte. See {Art}.]
     [1913 Webster]
     1. Destitute of the power of moving itself, or of active
        resistance to motion; as, matter is inert.
        [1913 Webster]
  
     2. Indisposed to move or act; very slow to act; sluggish;
        dull; inactive; indolent; lifeless.
        [1913 Webster]
  
              The inert and desponding party of the court.
                                                    --Macaulay.
        [1913 Webster]
  
              It present becomes extravagant, then imbecile, and
              at length utterly inert.              --I. Taylor.
        [1913 Webster]
  
     3. Not having or manifesting active properties; not affecting
        other substances when brought in contact with them;
        powerless for an expected or desired effect; as, the noble
        gases are chemically inert.
  
     Syn: Inactive; dull; passive; indolent; sluggish; slothful;
          lazy; lifeless; irresolute; stupid; senseless;
          insensible.
  
     Usage: {Inert}, {Inactive}, {Sluggish}. A man may be inactive
            from mere lack of stimulus to effort; but one who is
            inert has something in his constitution or his habits
            which operates like a weight holding him back from
            exertion. Sluggish is still stronger, implying some
            defect of temperament which directly impedes action.
            Inert and inactive are negative, sluggish is positive.
            [1913 Webster]
  
                  Even the favored isles . . .
                  Can boast but little virtue; and, inert

                  In manners -- victims of luxurious ease.
                                                    --Cowper.
            [1913 Webster]

                  obscurity.                        --Johnson.
            [1913 Webster]

        [1913 Webster]
  
     Note: A classification of clouds according to their chief
           forms was first proposed by the meteorologist Howard,
           and this is still substantially employed. The following
           varieties and subvarieties are recognized:
        (a) {Cirrus}. This is the most elevated of all the forms
            of clouds; is thin, long-drawn, sometimes looking like
            carded wool or hair, sometimes like a brush or room,
            sometimes in curl-like or fleecelike patches. It is
            the cat's-tail of the sailor, and the mare's-tail of
            the landsman.
        (b) {Cumulus}. This form appears in large masses of a
            hemispherical form, or nearly so, above, but flat
            below, one often piled above another, forming great
            clouds, common in the summer, and presenting the
            appearance of gigantic mountains crowned with snow. It
            often affords rain and thunder gusts.
        (c) {Stratus}. This form appears in layers or bands
            extending horizontally.
        (d) {Nimbus}. This form is characterized by its uniform
            gray tint and ragged edges; it covers the sky in
            seasons of continued rain, as in easterly storms, and
            is the proper rain cloud. The name is sometimes used
            to denote a raining cumulus, or cumulostratus.
        (e) {Cirro-cumulus}. This form consists, like the cirrus,
            of thin, broken, fleecelice clouds, but the parts are
            more or less rounded and regulary grouped. It is
            popularly called mackerel sky.
        (f) {Cirro-stratus}. In this form the patches of cirrus
            coalesce in long strata, between cirrus and stratus.
        (g) {Cumulo-stratus}. A form between cumulus and stratus,
            often assuming at the horizon a black or bluish tint.
            -- {Fog}, cloud, motionless, or nearly so, lying near
            or in contact with the earth's surface. -- {Storm
            scud}, cloud lying quite low, without form, and driven
            rapidly with the wind.
            [1913 Webster]
  
     2. A mass or volume of smoke, or flying dust, resembling
        vapor. "A thick cloud of incense." --Ezek. viii. 11.
        [1913 Webster]
  
     3. A dark vein or spot on a lighter material, as in marble;
        hence, a blemish or defect; as, a cloud upon one's
        reputation; a cloud on a title.
        [1913 Webster]
  
     4. That which has a dark, lowering, or threatening aspect;
        that which temporarily overshadows, obscures, or
        depresses; as, a cloud of sorrow; a cloud of war; a cloud
        upon the intellect.
        [1913 Webster]
  
     5. A great crowd or multitude; a vast collection. "So great a
        cloud of witnesses." --Heb. xii. 1.
        [1913 Webster]
  
     6. A large, loosely-knitted scarf, worn by women about the
        head.
        [1913 Webster]
  
     {Cloud on a} (or the) {title} (Law), a defect of title,
        usually superficial and capable of removal by release,
        decision in equity, or legislation.
  
     {To be under a cloud}, to be under suspicion or in disgrace;
        to be in disfavor.
  
     {In the clouds}, in the realm of facy and imagination; beyond
        reason; visionary.
        [1913 Webster]

From Easton's 1897 Bible Dictionary [easton]:

  Sovereignty
     of God, his absolute right to do all things according to his own
     good pleasure (Dan. 4:25, 35; Rom. 9:15-23; 1 Tim. 6:15; Rev.
     4:11).
     

From Bouvier's Law Dictionary, Revised 6th Ed (1856) [bouvier]:

  SOVEREIGNTY. The union and exercise of all human power possessed in a state; 
  it is a combination of all power; it is the power to do everything in a 
  state without accountability; to make laws, to execute and to apply them: to 
  impose and collect taxes, and, levy, contributions; to make war or peace; to 
  form treaties of alliance or of commerce with foreign nations, and the like. 
  Story on the Const. Sec. 207. 
       2. Abstractedly, sovereignty resides in the body of the nation and 
  belongs to the people. But these powers are generally exercised by 
  delegation. 
       3. When analysed, sovereignty is naturally divided into three great 
  powers; namely, the legislative, the executive, and the judiciary; the first 
  is the power to make new laws, and to correct and repeal the old; the second 
  is the power to execute the laws both at home and abroad; and the last is 
  the power to apply the laws to particular facts; to judge the disputes which 
  arise among the citizens, and to punish crimes. 
       4. Strictly speaking, in our republican forms of government, the 
  absolute sovereignty of the nation is in the people of the nation; (q.v.) 
  and the residuary sovereignty of each state, not granted to any of its 
  public functionaries, is in the people of the state. (q.v.) 2 Dall. 471; and 
  vide, generally, 2 Dall. 433, 455; 3 Dall. 93; 1 Story, Const. Sec. 208; 1 
  Toull. n. 20 Merl. Repert. h.t.
